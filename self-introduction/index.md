<h3>Self-introduction transcript:</h3>
Hello friend, thanks for watching my video.

Additionally, under this video I will leave links to my CV and my profile on linkedin and github.

Let's get started.

Now I'll tell you a little about me.

My name is Yury, I am 32 years old. I am from Belarus, from Grodno. I am a beginner front-end developer.

I am a graduate of the Modern Humanitarian Academy with a degree in Computer Science and am currently studying the JavaScript/Front-end course at RS School in Stage 1/Stage 2. I also previously studied at the College of Business and Law with a degree in Information Technology Software.

For many years I worked at Beltelecom as a telecommunications engineer, about 9 years, but it's a pity this work was not at all interesting and not creative, nothing changed, then at the same time I got a second job at a high school to develop and support the school website. Maybe you can say that I have 1 year of web development experience.

Now I regret a little that I didnâ€™t start doing web development earlier.

I plan to learn how to create modern and beautiful applications. In the future I want to learn React Native and understand backend development. I like to see the result of my work. I like to create beautiful and useful applications.

Also, I have recently successfully completed RS School JavaScript/Front-end Pre-school course and 3 courses from IT Academy in Website Development, Web Application Development using JavaScript and Web Application Development using React. For all my projects at IT Academy I received the maximum number of points, ten out of ten.

At the moment I am open for work, if necessary, I am ready for relocation, for example: to Minsk, Moscow, Saint Petersburg, maybe Poland or Lithuania.

That's all, I hope I didn't bore you with my self-introduction.

Thank you for listening. Good luck.
