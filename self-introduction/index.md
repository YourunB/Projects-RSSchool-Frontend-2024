  <p>Self-introduction text:</p>

  <p>Hello friend, thanks for watching my video.</p>

  <p>Additionally, under this video I will leave links to my CV and my profile on linkedin and github.</p>

  <p>Let's get started.</p>

  <p>Now I'll tell you a little about me.</p>

  <p>My name is Yury, I am 32 years old. I am from Belarus, am from Grodno. I'm a beginner front-end developer.</p>

  <p>I am a graduate of the Modern Humanitarian Academy with a degree in computer science and am currently taking a JavaScript/Front-end course at RS School. Previously, I also studied at the College of Business and Law in the field of information technology software.</p>

  <p>For many years I worked at Beltelecom as a telecommunications engineer, about 9 years, but it's a pity this work was not at all interesting and not creative, nothing changed, then at the same time I got a second job at a high school №8 to develop and support the school website. Maybe you can say that I have 1 year of web development experience./p>

  <p>Now I regret a little that I didn’t need to do web development earlier.</p>

  <p>I plan to learn how to create modern and beautiful applications. In the future I want to learn React Native and understand backend development. I like to see the result of my work. I like to create beautiful and useful applications.</p>

  <p>Also, I recently successfully completed the RS School JavaScript/Front-end Pre-school course and several courses at the IT Academy in JavaScript and React, receiving the maximum score for all my projects.</p>

  <p>At the moment I am open for work, if necessary, I am ready for relocation, for example: to Minsk, Moscow, Saint Petersburg, maybe Poland or Lithuania.</p>

  <p>That's all, I hope I didn't bore you with my CV.</p>

  <p>Thank you for listening and sorry for my English. Good luck.</p>
